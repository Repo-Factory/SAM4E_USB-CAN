Building on Linux

Need arm-none-eabi-gcc cross compiler for x86 to arm bare metal
Create Cmake File from scratch, using linking file generated from Atmel Studio
Compile like normal cmake 
    sudo rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make 

Download OpenOCD
Create this Config file
------------------------
interface cmsis-dap
cmsis_dap_vid_pid 0x03eb 0x2111                 // Use lsusb -d 03eb:2111 Note: You'll get this from command below
cmsis_dap_serial ATML2081061800000987           // You can get these values from lsusb command, search for atmel

set CHIPNAME SAM4E16E
source [find target/at91sam4sXX.cfg]
------------------------
Type openocd in terminal to listen on port 3333

You'll need arm-none-eabi-gdb
Start this with executable in another terminal like this
arm-none-eabi-gdb build/sam
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) monitor reset
